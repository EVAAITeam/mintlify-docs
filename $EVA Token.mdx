<h2>
🔥 Deflationary Tokenomics: Why \$EVA is Built to Hold</h2>

At the heart of **EVA** is a deflationary model designed to reward activity and tighten supply over time.

Every time someone trades with Instinct, EVA’s smart fee system kicks in behind the scenes — not just to keep the platform running, but to buy back and burn **\$EVA**.

⸻

## 🔶 Every Trade Reduces Supply

Instinct charges a 1% trading fee (which users can reduce via XP tiers). Here’s where the magic happens:

- A portion of every fee is used to automatically buy **\$EVA** from the open market
- That **\$EVA** is then burned — sent to a dead wallet, permanently removed from circulation
- This means: the more people trade, the scarcer **\$EVA** becomes

The result? Real utility meets real value. Usage fuels scarcity.

## 🔶 The More You Use, the More We Burn

Instinct is more than a trading bot — it’s a self-reinforcing flywheel:

1. Traders use Instinct to find and execute faster, safer trades
2. Every transaction feeds into \$EVA buybacks
3. Burned tokens = reduced supply
4. Reduced supply = increased scarcity
5. And as Instinct adoption grows, the burn accelerates

## 🔶 Holding \$EVA = Holding the Network

**\$EVA** isn’t just a token — it’s your stake in the security-first future of Web3.

By holding **\$EVA**, you benefit from:

- Deflationary pressure as the token supply shrinks
- Access to advanced tools through token-gated tiers
- Priority in feature rollouts and community initiatives
- Direct alignment with EVA’s growth and user activity

Whether you’re trading with Instinct or integrating our API, every interaction fuels the system.

### Security. Utility. Scarcity.

That’s what makes **\$EVA** a token worth holding.
