## Why EVA Exists

Smart contract code is powerful — but as history shows, **it’s also the biggest attack surface in Web3**.

>EVA eliminates blind trading.

Instead of reading code manually or relying on delayed audits, traders and developers get **instant clarity** on contract behavior using AI-powered pattern recognition and code similarity analysis.
